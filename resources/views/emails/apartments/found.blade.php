Hi,

I am a UBC Alumnus, now working as a software developer in downtown Vancouver.

I’ve recently come across the listing you posted online, and I was wondering if it's still available? I'm looking for a place for myself and my cat.

Whenever it's convenient for you, it would be great if we could have a conversation in person or, if it's better for you, we could continue a discussion online.

I'm available after 5:00 PM weekdays and any time of the day during the weekend. However, my schedule is quite flexible so I'm able to accommodate a time that works for you.

I’m very interested in learning more, and eager to hear back from you. Please feel free to message me and I will get back to you as soon as I can.

Thank you for your consideration,
<br>
